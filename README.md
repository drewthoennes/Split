## What it does
Stretch currently allows users come together and play a video on a larger screen by placing their phones together. When the app first opens, the users are prompted to either host a Stretch or join a Stretch. After entering a 4 letter code corresponding to the host room and the host chooses a video, a play video button can be pressed to start the video playing, part of it on each screen. The app is dynamic, allowing currently for either 2 or 3 users to join. The video adjusts to the size of the screens to provide a distortion-free image across the phones.
